                <h3>Hundreds of students have been attempting to exit their leases for months, but landlords continue to exploit students for illegal termination fees while continuing to charge students for months of rent for empty apartments that cannot be filled. We cannot stay silent while landlords are exploiting thousands of students. It’s time to work on our legal options. We are looking to cancel leases on the basis of illegal clauses being included in our respective leases. This will require extensive legal advice, and lead to potential lawsuits and class actions. Unfortunately, fighting exploitation will not come cheap.</h3>

                <h3><br>Due to the pandemic, our classes for the next semester are being held online, yet students across the country are trapped in off campus leases regardless of whether they chose to stay there. Campus housing is expensive - and the students most eager to save money on their educational expenses find housing off campus. Nonetheless, this specific population of responsible American students finds itself committed to pay rent for empty apartments. Our families are already impacted economically with lost wages - and having to pay for unutilized housing undermines our livelihood. We cannot afford to pay for an empty apartment when we are already struggling to pay rent or mortgage at home. 

                    <br><br>This situation is not unique to just UC Riverside students. The latest census data indicates that 25% of college students reside in off-campus housing (not with family). This amounts to well over 3 million students that may be forced by large real estate corporations to pay for leases, while these corporations take subsidies and bailouts from the government and get to pause their payments with their banks. 
            
                    <br><br>Many students can no longer afford rent and real estate companies are taking advantage of vulnerable students by threatening damage to credit scores and legal action. Help students fight exploitation. Scroll down to see how you can help!
